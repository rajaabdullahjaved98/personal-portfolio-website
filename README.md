# personal-portfolio-website
A responsive portfolio website that I created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
You won't see any sort of framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind, this is designed based on pure CSS.
Additional features have been developed using some JavaScript.
This is just a front-end website which is completely responsive in behaiviour and can fit the screen sizes of devices ranging from a 4K monitor to a tiny Mobile screen.

Tips:
Unzip the folder.
Make sure you have a stable internet connection so that all the resources can be fetched.
Open the "index.html" file to witness an eye-catching website ;)
